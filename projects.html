      <p>Some project highlights that I've done:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>That robot 6s(?) robot climb</li>
        <li>This website</li>
        <li>Text animation editor</li>
        <li>Appoarches to rotational zeroing</li>
        <li>Battleship sim</li>
        <li>Project HAMS (Project High Altitude MultiStage)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>I programmed a FRC robot to have a auto climb that completes in under 6s</h2>
      <p>Insert video here of robot going brrr</p>
      
      <h2>Text Animation Editor</h2>
      <p>
        I made a text animation program over the 23-24 school year. It has a multitude of animations and interfacing abilities. The entire thing
        was programmed by me based off with only basic rendering handled by p5.js. It's designed to be able to make animations for open slides
        or intergration into slide show for title transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the animations are a hand crafted algorithm designed and implemenented by myself. You can see some of the products of this project
        through out the web site. The general arcitechure of the project and design documentation is available <a href="">MISSING URL</a>
      </p>

      <h2>I made this website</h2>
      <p>
        This site is completly hand programmed in plain html, css, and js. None of those fancy frameworks. 
        Also note I'm not a web dev, just have far to much time and a set of skills
      </p>

      <h2>Project HAMS (Project High Altitude MultiStage)</h2>
      <p>
        A project reaching into ameature rocketry and avionics. With a goal of emulating the X-15 & X-11 programs. With a secondary goal of learning how to make
        low cost avionics and start learning about high powered ameature rocketry. With sub projects in differnt control radio control systems and GPS coordination.
