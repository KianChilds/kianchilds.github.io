      <h2>Text Animation Editor</h2>
      <p>
        I made a text animation program over the 23-24 school year. It has a multitude of animations and interfacing abilities. The entire thing
        was programmed by me based off with only basic rendering handled by p5.js. It's designed to be able to make animations for open slides
        or intergration into slide show for title transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the animations are a hand crafted algorithm designed and implemenented by myself. You can see some of the products of this project
        through out the web site. The animations code and part of the 'driver' section is open-source. With the main editor itself being closed source
        currently hosted at <a href="404.html" target="_blank">MISSING URL</a>. The overall design of the architure is can be viewed on its  <a href="projects/animationLib.html">page</a>
      </p>

      <h2>I made this website</h2>
      <p>
        This site is completly hand programmed in plain html, css, and js. None of those fancy frameworks. 
        Also note I'm not a web dev, just have far to much time and a set of skills
      </p>
